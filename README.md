## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

`npm start`

2. **Open the source code and start editing!**

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8080`!

_Note: I have added routing to navigate between views. Anyway, I have focused on the main view according to the instructions._
